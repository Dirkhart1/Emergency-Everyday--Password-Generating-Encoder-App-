# What is Emergency Everyday?
Emergency Everyday is a Program that helps you turn a simple easy-to-crack password into a far stronger password. Using only quick to remember infomation to generate a sophistcated password.

The intention of this program is guide you into creating a strong password while still making it easy to remember.
All you need to remember is:
- A password (with the help of this program, even "password123" could be considered strong)
- A 3 digit number (could ressemble anything, an example could your birthmonth + day (412) (April (4) 12th (12))

From there a new encoded password will be generated, and it should be exponentially more secured than the original entry.

My intention is for this program to has pratical use for personal acitvity (or even professionally)
so the password generation is created primarily with technical users in mind. 
However, having a strong password is general good practice so everyone is welcomed to try the program.

The GUI is created under the idea that the person who is looking is not familiar with technology.
So I crafted a GUI that looks like you are doing activity of a hacker (the reason why the font and colors is the way it is).

So I hope you'll find use for this program! Happy Password-Creating !

# How to run the program
The easiest and quickest way to run the program is the right click the "main.pyw" file and select "Open With" and look for python.
It will run the program from there.

To promote convenience you can create a shortcut and place it on your desktop to easily access it at any time.

If not of the method above works, then you might have to check if you have python installed.

# Future Improvements
I plan to remake this program using a more updated and modern technology, as Tkinter is pretty dated, but the program as it is does the job exactly as needed.

While creating this I also had the idea of making a plugin for browsers that does the same thing. The idea being, either a widget that does the same thing, or have it where your password is being encoded in real time.

Ultimately, the program is complete with all the features I believe would prove useful. So any future updates to this version of Emergency Everyday isn't likely to happen.
