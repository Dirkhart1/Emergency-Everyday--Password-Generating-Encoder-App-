# What is Emergency Everyday?
Emergency Everyday is a Program that helps you turn a simple easy-to-crack password into a far stronger password. Using only simple infomation to generate a sophistcated password.

The intention of this program is guide you into creating a personalized strong passwords by putting in simple infomation.
All you need to input is:
- A password (with the help of this program, even "password123" could be considered strong)
- A 3 digit number (could ressemble anything, an example could your birthmonth + day (412) (April (4) 12th (12))
- A website the password will be connected too
  
From there a new encoded password will be generated, and it should be exponentially more secured than the original entry.

My intention is for this program to has practical use for personal acitvity (or even professionally)
so the password generation is created primarily with technical users in mind. 
However, having a strong password is general good practice so everyone is welcomed to try the program.

The GUI is created under the idea that the person who is looking is not familiar with technology.
So I crafted a GUI that looks like you are doing activity of a hacker (the reason why the font and colors is the way it is).

So I hope you'll find use for this program! Happy Password-Creating !

# How to run the program
The easiest and quickest way to run the program is the right click the "main.pyw" file and select "Open With" and look for python.
It will run the program from there.

To promote convenience you can create a shortcut and place it on your desktop to easily access it at any time.

If not of the method above works, then you might have to check if you have python installed.

# Future Improvements
I plan to remake this program using a more updated and modern technology, as Tkinter is pretty dated, but the program as it is does the job exactly as needed.

- Improvement is planned on the way all the password infomation will be printed
- Allow the user to choose a password set to delete
- Better Interface design

# Technology Used
- Tkinter
- Python
